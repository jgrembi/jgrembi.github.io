The Grembi lab investigates the biological mechanisms of persistent childhood undernutrition, affecting over 150 million children worldwide. Learning from the limited success of nutritional interventions, our focus is on understanding the small intestineâ€™s physiological changes that hinder nutrient absorption. These adaptations may serve to prevent gut microbial translocation and infection. My lab aims to uncover the drivers of these processes to develop targeted interventions for improved growth and development in children from low-resource settings.

Adapted from <a href="https://lasy.github.io/publication/2021-Symul">Symul and Holmes, 2021</a>. Time series of body signs self-reported by a user of a fertility tracking app (bottom 5 rows), and the biological states (first two rows), manually labelled or inferred by our hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model (h-HSMM). Bleeding: darker shades of orange indicate heavier bleeding. Mucus: transparent, stretchy, egg-white like mucus is shown in blue, sticky mucus is shown in yellow. Temperature: above-average temperatures are shown in red, below-average ones in blue. Positive pregnancy and LH tests are shown in blue, negative ones in red. States (two first rows): pregnancy states are in shades of pink, postpartum states in green, menses are in red, follicular phase in blue, luteal phase in yellow, anovulatory phases are shown in gray.
