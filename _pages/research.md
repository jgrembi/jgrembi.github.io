Our research investigates the biological mechanisms of persistent childhood undernutrition, affecting over 150 million children worldwide. Learning from the limited success of nutritional interventions, our focus is on understanding the small intestineâ€™s physiological changes (environmental enteropathy) that hinder nutrient absorption. These adaptations may serve to prevent gut microbial translocation and infection, at the expense of child growth. My lab aims to uncover the drivers of these processes to develop targeted interventions for improved growth and development in children from low-resource settings. We approach these questions from several angles, as described below.

## Identifying altered immune function in chronically undernourished children

## Assessing the role of the developing gut microbiota in chronic childhood undernutrition 

## Evaluating immune function within the small intestine in pregnant women at high risk of environmental enteropathy
