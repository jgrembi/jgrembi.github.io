title: "Gut microbiota plasticity is correlated with sustained weight loss on a low-carb or low-fat dietary intervention"

excerpt: 'This paper looks for differences in the gut microbiota at baseline that might predict successful, sustained weight loss on a low-carb or low-fat diet. We found that the plasticity (day-to-day variability) of the gut microbota was correlated with long-term (12-month) weight loss in a diet-dependent manner. We emphasize the importance of validation cohorts in microbiome studies to generalize findings.'
